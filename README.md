# scite_ analytics plugin

## About

This plugin integrates [scite_](https://scite.ai/) with PKP-OJS, embedding a scite_ badge into the article details section.

scite_ receives the article DOI and creates a scite_ Section Badge. The Section Badge provides a breakdown of *where* in a derivative work the article is cited (i.e. Introduction, Methods, Discussion, etc.).
